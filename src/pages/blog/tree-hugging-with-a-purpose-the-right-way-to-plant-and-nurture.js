<p>See that guy in the photo? That&#8217;s me. I may not fit the mold of a quintessential tree hugger, with tie-dyed shirts and bare feet grounded in the earth. But my connection to these towering beings runs deep. Trees are more than just plants to me; they&#8217;re symbols of growth, resilience, and nature&#8217;s enduring beauty. As you read on, you&#8217;ll discover not just the science and art behind tree planting, but also the passion and dedication that drives us at Wilson&#8217;s Natural Landscaping. Welcome to our world, where every tree tells a story and every planting is a promise of a greener tomorrow.</p>



<p>Planting isn&#8217;t as simple as placing a sapling into the ground and hoping for the best. At its core, planting is about creating the perfect environment for a plant to not only grow but thrive. It&#8217;s a delicate balance of soil composition, hole size, and the right nutrients.</p>



<p><strong>Size Matters:</strong> When planting, the size of the hole is crucial. For a one-gallon plant, we recommend digging a hole that&#8217;s double the size. This two-gallon hole provides ample space for the roots to spread and grow without restriction.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Soil for Rich Growth:</strong> The soil you plant in can make all the difference. We advocate for soil that&#8217;s teeming with natural nutrients. Think of elements like pine bark, which enrich the soil and create a fertile bed for plants to flourish. It&#8217;s not just about feeding the plant; it&#8217;s about nourishing the very soil it calls home.</p>



<p><strong>A Proprietary Blend:</strong> We take pride in our unique organic fertilizer, a blend enriched with beneficial worm castings and mycorrhizae. This beneficial fungus forms a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, enhancing their ability to absorb nutrients. It&#8217;s nature&#8217;s way of ensuring plants get the nourishment they need.</p>



<p><strong>Steering Clear of the Artificial:</strong> In our commitment to natural growth, we do our best to avoid man-made fertilizers, especially those with generic ratios like 10/10/10. Such fertilizers can harm the plant, either by burning the roots or making the plant overly dependent on them. Our goal? Cultivate a soil ecosystem that&#8217;s self-sustaining and rich.</p>



<p><strong>Transitioning to Tougher Terrains:</strong> As plants grow and become more robust, they&#8217;re better equipped to handle challenging soils, like clay. Our nutrient-rich planting soil is introduced gradually, allowing the plant to adapt and eventually thrive in the native soil.</p>



<p><strong>A Liquid Boost:</strong> For clients seeking that extra push for their plants, we offer an organic, bio-based liquid fertilizer. It&#8217;s another testament to our dedication to natural, effective plant care.</p>



<p>In essence, our approach to planting is holistic. We believe in nurturing every aspect of the plant&#8217;s environment, ensuring it has the best foundation for growth.</p>

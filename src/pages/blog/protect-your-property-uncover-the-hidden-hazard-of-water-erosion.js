                 <p className="mt-3">Is your yard feeling spongy and waterlogged? At first glance, it might seem harmless, but neglecting drainage issues can lead to a host of serious problems, including the unexpected uprooting of your cherished trees. While most people attribute tree damage to strong winds, the truth often remains hidden beneath the surface – it’s water degradation of the root system that’s the silent culprit.</p>
<h3>Winds or Water? It’s Not What You Think</h3>
<p>Imagine this: a heavy rainstorm sweeps through the Charlotte metro area. Your yard becomes a waterlogged mess, unsightly puddles refusing to budge. It’s tempting to think, “It’s just a little water, no big deal.” But here’s the harsh reality – that excess water is seeping into the very heart of your landscape, wreaking havoc beneath the soil.</p>

<p>Your trees, those majestic guardians of your property, are in grave danger. The spongy ground, saturated with water, is compromising their root systems. As the roots weaken, your trees become vulnerable, teetering on the edge of disaster.</p>
